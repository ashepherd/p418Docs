example JSONLD generated from DataCite xml

filenames ending in xx were transformed from xml files obtained from DataCite using links like https://data.datacite.org/application/vnd.datacite.datacite+xml/10.1594/ieda/100577

filenames starting with php were transformed from new DataCite xml files from EarthChem library that will be used to update our DataCite metadata for those resources.


Note funding is in an 'isPartOf' key.
