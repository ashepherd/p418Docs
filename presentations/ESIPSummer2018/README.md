## ESIP Summer 2018

#### About
Just a place holder for now but I will flesh this out with the material Adam and I will 
present on the editing and authoring schema.org type Dataset in JSON-LD format.


Quick Thoughts
* Introduce the schema.org site and the terms vs typical ontology terms
* Basic simple exmaple 
* Discuss some issues we ran into
* Some validations tools (Google SDTT, JSON-LD Playground)  (talk about JSON-LD 1.0 vs 1.1)
* Introduce using schema and xforms tools
* introdcue ways to employ SHACL
